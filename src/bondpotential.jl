    RigidSpringPotential

A bond modelled as harmonic springs between two rigid clouds of patches, one carried by each of the
two bonded binding sites,

    V = -ε + Σ_α kα/2 ‖pα₁(q₁) - pα₂(q₂)‖² ,

with the patch `α` of site `i` sitting at `pαᵢ(qᵢ) = xᵢ + R(ψᵢ) aαᵢ`. Call it as
`potential(pose1, pose2, color1, color2)` on the lab poses of the two binding sites; the binding
energy `ε` is not included, as it is carried separately by the reaction network.

Only the total spring constant `k = Σ kα` and the patch (cross-)covariances
`Sᵢⱼ = k⁻¹ Σ kα aαᵢ aαⱼᵀ` enter, so those are what is stored. Since the poses are those of the
binding sites rather than of the particles, and bonded sites coincide, every cloud is taken to be
centred on its own site: patch positions are used only through their spread `aα - ā`.

See [`bondvolume`](@ref) for the configurational integral of a single such bond.
