What the pruning removes is a forest of branches hanging off that core, and a forest of bonds is
exactly what `TreeLike` gets right, so every bond it removes is charged one bond volume. The core is
where the cycles are, and `TreeLike` has nothing to say about those, so it is handed to `MeanField`.

The bonds removed are counted, not the particles: pruning a tree of `n` particles removes all `n` of
them but only `n - 1` bonds, and it is the bonds that carry the volumes.

Reduces to `TreeLike` on a tree, whose core is empty, and to `MeanField` on a structure that is its
